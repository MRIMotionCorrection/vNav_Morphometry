Added T2SPACE sequence.

These sequences are being distributed for feedback, and users should not expect that performance or behavior will be maintained across future versions, as the goal is continued optimization.

In addition, key features, such as automatic reacquisition, are not yet fully implemented. Expect these to become avialable in subsequent beta releases.

First beta release using the "new" registration algorithm. This sequence is being distributed for feedback, and users should not expect that performance or behavior of this sequence will be maintained across future versions, as the goal is continued optimization.

In addition, key features, such as automatic reacquisition, are not yet fully implemented. Expect these to become avialable in subsequent beta releases.
