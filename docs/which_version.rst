Which Version Should I Use?
===========================

To date, the most widely used vNav Morphometry package has been distributed by Massachusetts General Hospital. This package is used as part of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study, as well as Human Connectome Project Lifespan studies. It is being maintained to provide ongoing data collection compatibility with these studies. Users who are looking for these sequences should request the package from MGH here (http://www.martinos.org/c2p).

Siemens has released versions of the MPRAGE and T2 SPACE sequence as works in progress (WIP) packages for various software versions. If you are interested in their availability, we suggest you contact your local Siemens representative.

This documentation is for the "new generation" vNav Morphometry package, distributed by University of Pennsylvania and being adopted as part of the Healthy Brain Child Development (HBCD) study. This package is still under active development, but we are encouraging HBCD sites to begin filing their paperwork now (see :doc:`requesting`), to ensure timely distribution of the sequences as they become available.
