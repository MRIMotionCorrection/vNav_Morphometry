========================
Requesting the Sequences
========================

Requesting the vNav Morphometry package for the HBCD study (for a discussion of sequence versions, see :doc:`which_version`) is a two-step process. **Please note that both steps can be completed in parallel**; this will make the processing of requests more efficient. Once both steps are completed, we can share the installation package with you.

#. **Sign a C2P Agreement with Siemens**

Please fill out all the fields below under “Recipient Institution”. Provide this information to your Siemens representative, requesting a sequence C2P. Siemens should provide you with a document to be signed by your institution and Siemens. Once your institution and Siemens have both signed the agreement, please send the signed copy to Dylan Tisdall (mtisdall@pennmedicine.upenn.edu); please use an email subject line like "Completed C2P for vNav Morphometry".
